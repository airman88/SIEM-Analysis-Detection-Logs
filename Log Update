Added multiple failed login attempts from different IPs.

Added successful login events for normal users.

Included Logon Type details (e.g., Remote Interactive, Network).

Added account lockouts for repeated failures.

QA note: Analysts should verify correlation of failed vs successful logins, track IPs, and identify suspicious patterns like multiple failures or lockouts.

Changes made:

Added multiple process creation events.

Included command line variations, such as encoded PowerShell commands.

Added other processes like cmd.exe, svchost.exe for context.

Changes made:

Added multiple IDS alerts with different severity levels.

Expanded interface state changes (up/down).

Added port security violations with MAC addresses.

Added configuration change events.

QA note: Verify port security violations and interface events are logged accurately. Confirm MAC addresses and config changes match expected behavior.
